# EO Modulator Atlas

A traceable literature database and static browser explorer for electro-optic
modulators. The integrated atlas contains **8 papers, 16 devices and 19 organizations**
after p1_01 (2026-10-01); the candidate index contains 198 records and distillation
is continuing. Each reported metric has an evidence
locator and basis. Missing values stay empty.

## Run the app

Use Node 22.12+ (tested with Node 25.9) and pnpm 10.12.4:

```sh
cd engine
npx pnpm@10.12.4 install --frozen-lockfile
cd ../app
npx pnpm@10.12.4 install --frozen-lockfile
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite. Routes:

- `/table`: expandable paper/device table, filters, representative selection,
  evidence details and CSV export.
- `/explore`: metric comparisons, disclosure and organization views.
- `/sim?id=chen2022-c`: editable YAML, geometry preview and cancellable browser
  cross-section solver. The legacy `?config=sims/chen2022/config.yaml` URL also works.
- `/about`: metric conventions, evidence and current model limitations.

`npm run build` produces `app/build/`; `npm run preview` serves it locally.
`BASE_PATH=/eo-atlas npm run build` supports a subdirectory deployment. Dev/build
copy input YAML into ignored `app/static/sims/`; source PDFs are not copied to the
website. Install the engine dependencies before building the app.

## Database workflow

With Python 3.12+ and uv:

```sh
uv sync --extra dev --extra extract
uv run python scripts/validate_db.py
uv run pytest -q
uv run python scripts/build_views.py
```

Without uv, create a virtual environment and install the script dependencies:

```sh
python3.12 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install pydantic pyyaml requests pytest pymupdf
.venv/bin/python scripts/validate_db.py
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
.venv/bin/python scripts/build_views.py
```

The CSVs and `data/evidence/` are authoritative; `app/static/data/atlas.json` is
a generated view, not a second database. Refresh it after accepted data changes.
The [distillation skill](.claude/skills/eo-modulator-distill/SKILL.md),
[batch contract](data/_staging/BATCH_INSTRUCTIONS.md) and
[manual download list](data/manual_downloads.md) describe ingestion.
Reference PDFs, extracted text and figures are not tracked in this public repo; see
[references/README.md](references/README.md). Rights remain source-specific.

## Simulation status and checks

```sh
cd engine
npm test
cd ..
node engine/cli.mjs sims/chen2022/config.yaml
node engine/cli.mjs sims/chen2022/config.yaml --section unloaded
cd app
npm test
npm run check
npm run build
npm run smoke
```

The smoke suite requires an installed Google Chrome. It starts/stops its own
local preview server and temporary browser profile, tests the built site and
compares browser/Node calculations. For a subdirectory build, use the same
`BASE_PATH=/eo-atlas` for both `npm run build` and `npm run smoke`.
Optional `SMOKE_SCREENSHOTS=../logs/ui` keeps screenshots in ignored local scratch.

The engine runs **electrostatics and optional scalar optical modes**. Analytic
gates cover parallel plates, differential/half-domain capacitance, anisotropic
rotation, TE/TM slab modes and waveguide group index. CLI results go to stdout;
browser results stay in memory. Do not commit solver outputs.

EO overlap, RF loss, the periodic loaded-line model and EO response remain pending.
A cross-section's RF index and impedance are not the effective values of a
periodically loaded device. Such targets are reported as `not_evaluated`.
The Chen config remains `unvalidated`. Its optical window intersects gold, so
`--optical` currently stops with an explicit unsupported-material error; it does
not substitute an invented optical index. Tests of the optical solver use
dielectric slab fixtures.

Incomplete drafts such as Deng 2026 can display their geometry, missing inputs
and provenance while Run stays disabled. Previewing a draft does not supply
physical constants or validate the device. New configs and their audit findings
are tracked in [DevLog-004](DevLog/DevLog-004-data-lane-progress.md).

CLI exit codes: 0 = requested stages completed (not a literature pass), 1 = input
or solver error, 2 = an evaluated target missed its tolerance. Mesh scale changes
numerical resolution only. Results need mesh/domain convergence checks before
physical interpretation. See [sims/SPEC.md](sims/SPEC.md) and
[engine/README.md](engine/README.md).

The shared runner reports target coverage separately from pass/fail. Unspecified
line topology, frequency-specific targets, alternate-section targets and configured
fixed group index are excluded from prediction comparisons. Each mesh has an
80,000-vertex default budget; exceeding it produces an explicit error.

## Next work

1. Add metal-aware/vector optical handling and explicit EO drive/arm conventions.
2. Implement EO overlap, RF loss and periodic-cell/EO-response stages with analytic gates.
3. Continue the remaining priority-1 batches, merging only reviewed rows.
4. Complete literature regressions and independent evidence audits.

Current work and remaining phases are recorded in [DevLog-000](DevLog/DevLog-000-plan.md)
and [DevLog-002](DevLog/DevLog-002-work-plan-and-ownership.md).
E1/U1 progress, final checks and handoff: [DevLog-003](DevLog/DevLog-003-cross-section-progress.md).

`coordination/claims/` before starting concurrent work.
